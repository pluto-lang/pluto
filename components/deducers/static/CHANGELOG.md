### Patch Changes

- b3400ad: feat(deducer): allow using direct captured properties as arguments in infra API

  This change introduces the ability to use direct captured properties as arguments in infrastructure API calls. For instance, the code below is now considered valid:

  ```python
  from pluto_client import Website, Router

  router = Router("router")
  website = Website(path="path/to/website", name="website")

  website.addEnv("ROUTER", router.url())
  ```

  In this example, `router.url()` is a direct captured property which the website utilizes to establish a connection to the backend service.

  The goal is for the infrastructure API to accept both direct captured properties and variables assigned with these properties, as demonstrated here:

  ```python
  from pluto_client import Website, Router

  router = Router("router")
  website = Website(path="path/to/website", name="website")

  router_url = router.url()
  website.addEnv("ROUTER", router_url)
  ```

  Currently, the API only accepts direct captured properties as arguments. Future updates will include support for variables that store the return values of these properties.

### Patch Changes

- 4cfb9a8: feat(deducer): use the `name` parameter from the new expression as the resource object name

  Previously, the resource object's name was derived from the resource variable name, causing discrepancies between compilation and runtime. This update utilizes the `name` parameter from the new expression for naming the resource object during compilation, defaulting to `default` when not provided.

## 0.4.0

### Minor Changes

- 1c3c5fa: feat: python support, validated with quickstart

  We created a deducer using Pyright. It can automatically analyze the dependent packages for each section of business logic, and the adapter includes them in the zip archive for publishing on AWS Lambda.

  Currently, Pluto supports simple Python projects. Users can use the pluto command to create and deploy Python projects. However, if the project relies on packages with different distribution packages on various platforms, or if the archive size after zipping exceeds the AWS limit of 50 MB, it will fail.
